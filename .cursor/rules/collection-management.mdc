# Collection Management Guide

The application includes a complete system for organizing SVGs into collections and folders.

## Collection Structure
- Collections are defined in [app/types/index.ts](mdc:app/types/index.ts) with the following hierarchy:
  - `Collection`: Top-level container with a name, ID, and array of folders
  - `Folder`: Container within a collection with a name, ID, and array of SVG items
  - `SVGItem`: Individual SVG with name, ID, SVG code, and metadata

## State Management
- Collection state is managed through [app/context/CollectionsContext.tsx](mdc:app/context/CollectionsContext.tsx)
- The context provides:
  - `collections`: Current collections array
  - Active collection and folder tracking
  - Functions for manipulating collections

## Storage and Persistence
- Collections are stored in localStorage using:
  - `loadCollections`: Loads collections from localStorage
  - `saveCollections`: Saves collections to localStorage
- Each item includes a `sortOrder` property for maintaining order

## Collection Operations
The following operations are supported via [app/utils/collectionUtils.ts](mdc:app/utils/collectionUtils.ts):
- Creating collections and folders
- Saving SVGs to folders
- Toggling open/closed state of collections and folders
- Deleting collections, folders, and SVGs

## User Interface
- The collections UI is implemented in [app/components/CollectionSidebar.tsx](mdc:app/components/CollectionSidebar.tsx)
- Features include:
  - Collapsible sidebar with toggle button
  - Collection and folder management
  - SVG previews in the sidebar
  - Drag and drop reordering
